       <h1>How to apply for the externship</h1>
    
    <p>
      Some knowledge of AI is required, but students do not have to be machine learning (ML) specialists. Being able to program is a requirement, but occasionally we will have projects available where standard AI can be used and programming is easy. When you apply indicate if you already have a (potential) project or if you want to get a project from us. If you want a project from us indicate what disciplines you are mostly interested in and/or have a background in. (Ecology, Biology, Plant science, Anthropology, Linguistics, Law, Social Science, Mathematics, Medicine and Health, etc.). Then we will find a project in the right area.
    </p>
  
    <p>
During the externship you will, in principle, perform the work remotely, but we will provide support on the topic. We will organise online meetings with experts in the Arctic and also possibilities to exchange and collaborate between students. Of course, if you are available to come to the Arctic that is great, but we cannot provide funding for all students to do this. We will give certificates that you have performed the work, which can be used at your own institution to fulfill requirements to get ects. You can do this externship as (part of) a course, internship or a Master degree project. We only require that you spend at least 4 months on the project, but longer periods are also possible (and encouraged).       </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested in the externship, please use this form to apply.
