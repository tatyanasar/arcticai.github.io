    <h1>Externships on Arctic AI</h1>

    <p>
      
In the past few years AI has become available for the wide public through the use of LLM’s and other generative AI tools. The realization has come that AI might also be a useful tool to support people living in the Arctic. Within Umeå university this led to a cooperation between the Arctic Center and TAIGA and the creation of the TAIGA theme “Arctic AI” and the proposal of a thematic network on Arctic AI at the Universities of the Arctic.

      <p>
      Within this are we have a network of people that work in the Arctic on many different topics that want to explore the use of AI. Some examples are:
        <ul>
  <li>Geolocation of black and white pictures of the Sámi archive in order to link them to events, people and journals of the Arctic region.  This could also help to identify changes in the landscape and climate over the years by collocating pictures of different years of the same place.</li>
              <div class="images">
      <img src="download.png" alt="Image 1">
      <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
     </div>
  <li>Creating micro climate models in remote regions based on sensor information and making this available for reindeer herders to support them in finding the best regions to move their herds to.</li>
  <li>Performing NLP on small languages in the Arctic for which there is not enough data to use the standard LLMs.</li>
  <li>Preserving traditional knowledge in a format that does justice to that knowledge and makes it practically available for people from the Sámi communities. This can be used to assist in land use disputes, preserving culture, etc. </li>
</ul>

    </p>
    <p>
      
        The above are just a few examples of topics for which we are looking for students that are interested to work on topics of Arctic AI in a transdisciplinary way. Some knowledge of AI is required, but students do not have to be ML specialists. Being able to program is a requirement, but occasionally we will have projects available where standard AI can be used and programming is easy. When you apply indicate if you already have a (potential) project or if you want to get a project from us. If you want a project from us indicate what disciplines you are mostly interested in and/or have a background in. (Ecology, Biology, Plant science, Anthropology, Linguistics, Law, Social Science, Mathematics, Medicine and Health, etc.). Then we will find a project in the right area.
In an externship you will, in principle, perform the work remotely, but we will provide support on the topic. We will organise online meetings with experts in the Arctic and also possibilities to exchange and collaborate between students. Of course, if you are available to come to the Arctic that is great, but we cannot provide funding for all students to do this. We will give certificates that you have performed the work, which can be used at your own institution to fulfil requirements to get ects. You can do this externship as (part of) a course, internship or master project. We only require that you spend at least 4 months on the project, but longer periods are also possible (and encouraged).
